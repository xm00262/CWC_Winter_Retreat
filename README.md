# CWC_Winter_Retreat
This is the repository designed and facilitated for the development for CWC_Winter_Retreat web service.

NOTE: 
Confirmation_ID is a big array generated automatically from database thanks for pi(). Later, we have to link the CWC_ID with this unique array to make a meaningful ID for each registree.

Formula: ((((((pi()+10.987)/pi() + (family_count+1.321)/family_count)))+1.234)*10000000000.

In this formula, the Variable is family_count only, it is a serial which will auto-increment 1 per family, and it is different from family_ID.

When you begin to create the tables, please always create Family table first, since others are related to this root table.
